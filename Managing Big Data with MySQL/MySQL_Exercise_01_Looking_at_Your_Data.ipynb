    "# MySQL Exercise 1: Welcome to your first notebook!\n",
    "\n",
    "Database interfaces vary greatly across platforms and companies.  The interface you will be using here, called Jupyter, is a web application designed for data science teams who need to create and share documents that share live code.  We will be taking advantage of Jupyter's ability to integrate instructional text with areas that allow you to write and run SQL queries.  In this course, you will practice writing queries about the Dognition data set in these Jupyter notebooks as I give you step-by-step instructions through written text.  Then once you are comfortable with the query syntax, you will practice writing queries about the Dillard's data set in Teradata Viewpoint's more traditional SQL interface, called SQL scratchpad. Your assessments each week will be based on the exercises you complete using the Dillard's dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter runs in a language called Python, so some of the commands you will run in these MySQL exercises will require incorporating small amounts of Python code, along with the MySQL query itself.  Python is a very popular programming language with many statistical and visualization libraries, so you will likely encounter it in other business analysis settings.  Since many data analysis projects do not use Python, however, I will point out to you what parts of the commands are specific to Python interfaces. \n",
