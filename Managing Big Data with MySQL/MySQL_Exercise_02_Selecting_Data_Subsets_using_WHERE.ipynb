In this lesson you will learn how to select subsets of rows of data that meet criteria you specify, to help you prepare for these types of business questions.  The mechanism within a SQL query that allows you specify which subset of data you want to retrieve is the WHERE clause.\n",

    "Next, let's try using the WHERE statement to interact with datetime data.  Time-related data is a little more complicated to work with than other types of data, because it must have a very specific format.  MySQL comes with the following data types for storing a date or a date/time value in the database:\n",

    "YEAR - format YYYY or YY\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the interesting things about time-related data is that SQL has commands to break the data into different \"time parts\" or \"date parts\" as described here:\n",
    "\n",
    "http://www.tutorialspoint.com/mysql/mysql-date-time-functions.htm\n",

    "```\n",
    "The year part of that entry would be 2013, the month part would be \"02\" or \"February\" (depending on the requested format), the seconds part would be \"52\", and so on.  SQL functions easily allow you to convert those parts into formats you might need for specific analyses.  For example, imagine you wanted to know how many tests Dognition customers complete on different days of the week.  To complete this analysis, you would need to convert the time stamps of each completed test to a variable that outputted the correct day of the week for that date.  DAYNAME is a function that will do this for you.  You can combine DAYNAME with WHERE to select data from only a single day of the week:\n",

    "FROM complete_tests\n",
    "WHERE DAYNAME(created_at)=\"Tuesday\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use common operators like =,<,>,<=,>=,!=, or <> with dates just like you would with other types of data, but whether you refer to the date as a number or text will depend on whether you are selecting individual date parts or treating the date/time entry as a single clause.   For example, you could select all the Dog IDs and time stamps of tests completed after the 15 of every month with this command that extracts the \"DAY\" date part out of each time stamp:\n",
    "\n",
    "```mySQL\n",
    "SELECT dog_guid, created_at\n",
    "FROM complete_tests\n",
    "WHERE DAY(created_at) > 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You could also select all the Dog IDs and time stamps of completed tests from after February 4, 2014 by treating date entries as text clauses with the following query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```mySQL\n",
    "SELECT dog_guid, created_at\n",
    "FROM complete_tests\n",
    "WHERE created_at > '2014-02-04'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you have to use a different set of functions than you would use for regular numerical data to add or subtract time from any values in these datetime formats.  For example, instead of using a minus sign to find the difference in time between two time stamps or dates, you would use the TIMEDIFF or DATEDIFF function.  See the references provided above for a list of these functions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 4: Now that you have seen how datetime data can be used to impose criteria on the data you select, how would you select all the Dog IDs and time stamps of Dognition tests completed before October 15, 2015 (your output should have 193,246 rows)?**"
