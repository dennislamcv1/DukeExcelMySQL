    "Recall that tables in relational databases are linked through primary keys and sometimes other fields that are common to multiple tables (as is the case with our Dognition data set).  Our goal when we execute a JOIN or make a joined table is to use those common columns to let the database figure out which rows in one table match up to which rows in another table.  Once that mapping is established using at least one common field or column, the database can pull any columns you want out of the mapped, or joined, tables and output the matched data to one common table.\n",

    "To illustrate how this works, let's find out whether dog owners that are particularly surprised by their dog's performance on Dognition tests tend to own similar breeds (or breed types, or breed groups) of dogs.  There are many ways to address this question, but let's start by focusing on the dog owners who provided at least 10 ratings for one or more of their dogs in the ratings table. Of these owners, which 200 owners reported the highest average amount of surprise at their dog's performance, and what was the breed, breed_type, and breed_group of each of these owner's dog?\n",
    "\n",
    "The surprise ratings are stored in the reviews table.  The dog breed information is provided in the dogs table.  There are two columns that are common to both tables: user_guid and dog_guid. How do we use the common columns to combine information from the two tables? \n",
    "\n",
    "To join the tables, you can use a WHERE clause and add a couple of details to the FROM clause so that the database knows from what table each field in your SELECT clause comes.  \n",

    "\n",
    "```mySQL\n",
    "SELECT dog_guid AS DogID, user_guid AS UserID, AVG(rating) AS AvgRating, \n",
    "       COUNT(rating) AS NumRatings, breed, breed_group, breed_type\n",
    "```\n",
    "then list all the tables from which the fields we are interested in come, separated by commas (with no comma at the end of the list):\n",
    "\n",
    "```mySQL\n",
    "FROM dogs, reviews\n",

To join multiple tables you take the same approach as we took when we were joining two tables together: list all the fields you want to extract in the SELECT statement, specify which table they came from in the SELECT statement, list all the tables from which you will need to extract the fields in the FROM statement, and then tell the database how to connect the tables in the WHERE statement.\n",

However, it turns out that our Dognition dataset has only NULL values in the user_guid column of the complete_tests table.  If you were to execute the query above, you would not get an error message, but your output would have 0 rows.  However, the power of relational databases will come in handy here.  You can use the dogs table to link the complete_tests and users table (pay attention to the difference between the WHERE statement in this query vs. the WHERE statement in the query above):\n",
