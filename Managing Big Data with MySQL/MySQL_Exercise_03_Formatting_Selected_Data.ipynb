    "## 1. Use AS to change the titles of the columns in your output\n",
    "\n",
    "The AS clause allows you to assign an alias (a temporary name) to a table or a column in a table.  Aliases can be useful for increasing the readability of queries, for abbreviating long names, and for changing column titles in query outputs.  To implement the AS clause, include it in your query code immediately after the column or table you want to rename.  For example, if you wanted to change the name of the time stamp field of the completed_tests table from \"created_at\" to \"time_stamp\" in your output, you could take advantage of the AS clause and execute the following query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```mySQL\n",
    "SELECT dog_guid, created_at AS time_stamp\n",
    "FROM complete_tests\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if you use an alias that includes a space, the alias must be surrounded in quotes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```mySQL\n",
    "SELECT dog_guid, created_at AS \"time stamp\"\n",
    "FROM complete_tests\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You could also make an alias for a table:\n",

    "SELECT dog_guid, created_at AS \"time stamp\"\n",
    "FROM complete_tests AS tests\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since aliases are strings, again, MySQL accepts both double and single quotation marks, but some database systems only accept single quotation marks. It is good practice to avoid using SQL keywords in your aliases, but if you have to use an SQL keyword in your alias for some reason, the string must be enclosed in backticks instead of quotation marks.\n",

    "## 2. Use DISTINCT to remove duplicate rows\n",
    "\n",
    "Especially in databases like the Dognition database where no primary keys were declared in each table, sometimes entire duplicate rows can be entered in error.  Even with no duplicate rows present, sometimes your queries correctly output multiple instances of the same value in a column, but you are interested in knowing what the different possible values in the column are, not what each value in each row is. In both of these cases, the best way to arrive at the clean results you want is to instruct the query to return only values that are distinct, or different from all the rest.  The SQL keyword that allows you to do this is called DISTINCT.  To use it in a query, place it directly after the word SELECT in your query.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we wanted a list of all the breeds of dogs in the Dognition database, we could try the following query from a previous exercise:\n",

    "FROM dogs;\n",

    "However, the output of this query would not be very helpful, because it would output the entry for every single row in the breed column of the dogs table, regardless of whether it duplicated the breed of a previous entry.  Fortunately, we could arrive at the list we want by executing the following query with the DISTINCT modifier:\n",

You can tell MySQL to put the results of a query into a variable (for our purposes consider a variable to be a temporary holding place), and then use Python code to format the data in the variable as a CSV file (comma separated value file, a .CSV file) that can be downloaded.  When you use this strategy, all of the results of a query will be saved into the variable, not just the first 1000 rows as displayed in Jupyter, even if we have set up Jupyter to only display 1000 rows of the output.  \n",
